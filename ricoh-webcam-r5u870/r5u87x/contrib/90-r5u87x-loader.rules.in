# 90-r5u87x-loader.rules - udev rules for loading firmware into Ricoh R5U87x USB video devices
###
### This file is processed by the Makefile to create the final file. Each
### USB id gets its own line as defined by the section between BEGINTEMPLATE
### and ENDTEMPLATE. In the template, the strings #VENDORID#, #PRODUCTID# and
### #LOADER# are replaced by their values. This template line is repeated for
### each file in the directory ucode/ with a USB id.
###
### Lines starting with three hashes are removed from this file.
